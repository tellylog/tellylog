The series follows Dexter, a boy-genius with a secret laboratory filled with his collection of inventions. He constantly battles his sister Dee Dee, who always gains access despite his best efforts to keep her out, as well as his arch-rival and neighbor, Mandark. The series' first two seasons contain additional segments: Dial M for Monkey, which focuses on Dexter's pet lab monkey-turned-superhero, and The Justice Friends, about a trio of superheroes who share an apartment.\n\nTartakovsky first pitched the series to Hanna-Barbera's animated shorts showcase World Premiere Toons, basing it on student films he produced while attending the California Institute of the Arts. Four shorts were created and broadcast on Cartoon Network in 1995 and 1996 before viewer approval ratings convinced the network to order a 13-episode first season, which premiered on April 28, 1996. By 1999, 52 episodes and a television movie had been produced, and Tartakovsky then left the series to begin work on his other projects, Samurai Jack and Star Wars: Clone Wars. In 2001, the network revived the series under a different production team at Cartoon Network Studios, and after 26 more episodes, the series ended on November 20, 2003.", "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "added": "2015-12-30T14:33:38.141Z", "last_update": "2015-12-30T14:33:38.141Z", "genres": [1, 5, 9, 10], "origin_country": [1]}}, {"model": "tv.series", "pk": 19, "fields": {"name": "Cliff Dexter", "tmdb_id": 40966, "poster_small": "tv/poster/series/small/4e1552f94d92f3e8be67fbe4fd7a6da9.jpg", "poster_large": "tv/poster/series/large/b97f3d1582ba497ed0dd7b41ef9c0055.jpg", "in_production": false, "first_air_date": "1966-10-19", "episode_run_time": 25, "last_air_date": "1968-02-07", "number_of_episodes": 26, "number_of_seasons": 2, "original_language": "de", "overview": "Cliff Dexter was a detective series in the ZDF 1966 until 1968.

James Doakes imprisoned in an Everglades cabin and learns from him that her object of affection, Dexter Morgan, is the serial killer known as the \"Bay Harbor Butcher\". She decides to help Dexter and kills Doakes by setting the cabin on fire. Meanwhile, Dexter's sister Debra questions whether her career is more important than her relationship with FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy.\n\n\"The British Invasion\" was filmed in early November 2007. Doakes's death, according to Dexter's writers, was premeditated from the show's pilot episode because the character was \"too good to not kill\". The episode was seen by 1.4 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, and received mixed reviews from critics. It was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Cinematography for a One-Hour Series and a Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing \u2013 Sound Effects and Foley for Short Form Television.
